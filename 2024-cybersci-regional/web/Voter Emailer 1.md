We can access the FastAPI docs via the `/docs` path. http://10.0.2.21:8000/docs

Which tells us that we can access tools via the `/tools` path.
## second part

> was not solved during the event.

I managed to run arbitrary commands but couldn't figure out how to read the files requested.

It was only after the event that it was revealed.
