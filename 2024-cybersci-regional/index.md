Loved the free food, ate like 10 sandwiches.

Anyways it was a fun event, had a nice interview with red team manager from Air Canada.

Time was really tight, spent way too much time on the other challenges, should've just spent all of my time on defence challenges and we could've probably gotten second place.

Spent IDK how long looking at that call centre challenge.
