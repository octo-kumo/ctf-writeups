All attempts with volatility failed. So I decided to just analyse the strings manually on a hex editor.

Volatility always complain about kernel mappings and plugins, maybe the memory dump was corrupted, who knows.

Na√Øve search of `irisctf` failed. So I decided to look for the base64 encoded flag headers.

```
irisctf
irisctf
!irisctfz
zirisctf!
!!irisctfzz
zzirisctf!!

```
aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2FuX2
irisctf{i_am_an_
```

Nice, first guess and I've got it.

Next search for `aXJpc2N0ZntpX2FtX2FuX2`

irisctf{i_am_an_idiot_with_bad_memory}7
```

```flag
irisctf{i_am_an_idiot_with_bad_memory}
```

And the challenge is solved.
