Bro kroot. How about you stfu about genetics and go hit the gym. Ever since [REDACTED] posted the pic instead of complimenting him like everybody else you've said 'insane genetics' twice like a moron. I guarantee you everyone in this server is able to achieve a physique like that. I'm not saying that because it's easy, it's still a f**k ton of work like what [REDACTED] had to put in, but saying it's impossible for you purely because of genetics shows you're a lazy a**. Sure genetics can have a factor once you're body-builder level, although [REDACTED] isn't there yet, genetics won't block you from getting to where he is. Also if you're gonna say sh*t like that at least be in a position to do it like neil and complain about something specific like bulking rather than saying 'genetics'. Thinking [REDACTED] got to where he is because of 'genetics' insults many many months of hard work and consistency, so respectfully shut the f**k up.
