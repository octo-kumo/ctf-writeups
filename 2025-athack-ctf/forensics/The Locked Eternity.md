```bash
└─$ grep -r "QVRIQUNLQ1RGe" .

└─$ grep -r "ATHACKCTF" .
grep: ./LiveResponseData/CopiedFiles/Houssem0x1/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/NoteStore.sqlite-wal: binary file matches
```

```flag
ATHACKCTF{Keych41nDB_&_4utoLog1n_4_the_WIN!!!}
```

Couldn't solve it, turns out theres a keys file that has to be decrypted.
