## Overview

The **UK47XD** is an 32bit microcontroller designed for secure embedded applications. It features a simple memory layout, UART-based communication, and built-in security features to prevent tampering and unauthorized code execution. It is primarily used in the lighting industry.

## Memory Map
The memory map layout which programmers can access is organized as follows:

| Address Range     | Description                  |
|----------------   |------------------------------|
| `0x0000–0x036F`   | Boot Section                 |
| `0x0370–0x0EDBFF` | Application Flash (User Area)|

> **Note**: Any access to any other addresses will result in a hard fault, requiring a reboot of the processor.

## UART Communication

UK47XD communicates with external devices via UART at 115200 baud, 8N1.

### UART Registers

| Address   | Name         | Description             |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------|
| `0x0100`  | `UART_DATA`  | Data Register (R/W)     |
| `0x0101`  | `UART_STAT`  | Status Register (R)     |
| `0x0102`  | `UART_CTRL`  | Control Register (W)    |

#### UART Status Register Bits

- Bit 0: TX Ready
- Bit 1: RX Available
- Bit 7: Error Flag

### Programming Mode

The UK47XD can be programmed over UART. In order to signal to the processor that you would like to interact with it over UART, simply send the bytes `[0x55, 0x0, 0xC1, 0x0]` within 5 seconds of booting the processor. The processor should then respond with an acknowledgement packet.

#### Programming Mode Commands

##### Packet Format

The transport packet format for all transactions is as follows:

```C
struct Packet {
    uint8_t HEAD; // 0x33
    uint16_t LEN; // Length of data that comes after this field, in little endian.
    PACKET_INTERNAL_DATA DATA; // Data that is stored here
}

struct PACKET_INTERNAL_DATA {
    COMMANDS CMD; // Command Index
    RESPONSES STATUS; // Status, used by the system whenever something goes wrong.
    uint8_t ARGS[LEN - 2]; // The bytes for the arguments. It will be LEN - 1.
}
```

##### Command Indices

```C
typedef enum {
    UNKNOWN = 0x0,
    COMM_INIT = 0x3,
    SET_CHIP_FREQ = 0x5,
    ID_AUTHENTICATION = 0x34,
    READ = 0x69,
} COMMANDS;
```

##### Response/Status Indices

```C
typedef enum {
    ACK = 0x50,
    INVALID_COMMAND = 0x80,
    FLOW_ERROR = 0x81,
    UNAUTHORIZED = 0x82,
    INVALID_FREQUENCY = 0x83,
    INVALID_ID_LEN = 0x84,
    INVALID_ADDRESS = 0x87,
    INVALID_ADDRESS_ALIGNMENT = 0x88,
} RESPONSES;
```

###### Responses

The status field in a data packet can be set to one of the following values:

- ACK: Used as an acknowledgement.
- INVALID_COMMAND: Used to report a bad command.
- FLOW_ERROR: Used to report a command sent out of order.
- UNAUTHORIZED: Used to signify an authentication failure.
- INVALID_FREQUENCY: Used to signify an invalid frquency being set.
- INVALID_ID_LEN: Used to signify a malformed ID.
- INVALID_ADDRESS: Used to signify a bad/out of bounds address.
- INVALID_ADDRESS_ALIGNMENT: Used to signify an address that is not 0x400 aligned.

###### Data Packets

As implied by the above, the inline data packets need a `type`, `status`, and `args` section (if applicable) for successful communication.

- The `type` will be of the command being sent or acknowledged.
- The `status` is one of those in the RESPONSE enum. If you are sending a command, you do not need to fill out this field; the UK47XD will fill this field, however.
- The `args` section just contains the raw data that you are trying to pass in.

###### Commands.COMM_INIT

Initializes communication with the processor over UART. This must be sent before any other command is sent, otherwise you will receive a packet with a `FLOW_ERROR`. Upon success, you will receive an acknowledgement back from the system.

Example packet structure: ```[0x33, 0x2, 0x0, 0x3, 0x0]```

###### Commands.SET_CHIP_FREQ

Sets the processor speed in megahertz. This must be sent after the `COMM_INIT` command. Upon success, you will receive an acknowledgement back from the system. You must use either 8 or 16 MHz, as these are the only two operating frequencies.

Example packet structure (to set to 8 MHz): ```[0x33, 0x5, 0x0, 0x5, 0x00, 0x12, 0x7A, 0x00]```

###### Commands.ID_AUTHENTICATION

Unlocks the chip for reading. This must be sent after the `COMM_INIT` command, and the `SET_CHIP_FREQ`, in that order. Upon success, you will receive an acknowledgement back from the system. This cannot be bruteforced; if an attempt is made, the chip is wiped for security reasons (see below).

Example packet structure (assuming the password is DEADBEEFDEADBEEF): ```[0x33, 0x11, 0x0, 0x34, 0x44, 0x43, 0x41, 0x44, 0x42, 0x45, 0x45, 0x46, 0x44, 0x43, 0x41, 0x44, 0x42, 0x45, 0x45, 0x46]```

###### Commands.READ

Reads 0x400 bytes from a region. This must be sent after the unlocking the chip (see `ID_AUTHENTICATION`). Upon success, you will receive an acknowledgement back from the system, containing the 0x400 bytes.

Example packet structure (reading from 0x112233): ```[0x33, 0x5, 0x0, 0x69, 0x33, 0x22, 0x11, 0x00]```

## Security Features

The UK47XD includes several mechanisms for runtime and firmware security.

- An ID can be used to secure your processor. This is a 16 byte ID consisting of CAPITAL alphabetical characters 'A' through 'Z'. If a user attempts to bruteforce this password, the chip will be erased, preserving the contents.
- The JTAG fuses can be blown to prevent tampering, or the OTP register set.
- SWD is disabled unless you specifically request a development board from UNC Holdings.
- As stated before, the bootrom and other secure assets cannot be read out, only user area.
- Sudden voltage changes or glitching attempts will trigger a system reset.
